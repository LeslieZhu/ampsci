Dirac BS code.
Solves local central-field problem for Dirac equation.

With reasonable choices for the integration grids, typically converges to around 1e-16

Includes a parameter to vary the effective speed of light - allowing non-relativistic approximation.

The program currently named "test.cpp" includes main(), and shows an example.
