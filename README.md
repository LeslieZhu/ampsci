Dirac BS code.
Solves local central-field problem for Dirac equation
(i.e. H-like atoms/ions)
Code very rough, still needs some work.



# To Do 

 * Fix variables, constants etc
 * CL thing?
 * Kill all 'variable' arrays
 * Finish fixing up solvebs (comments etc)
 * --Also, check 'PT' etc (method)
 * V, r etc: have functions, but read into arrays!
 * funs: fix. impliment a few files, newer version of invertMat, for example
